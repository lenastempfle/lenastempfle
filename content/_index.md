        At the Healthy AI Lab, we draw motivation and inspiration from challenges in healthcare settings, developing machine learning models and theory to address real-world clinical needs. Through collaborations with clinician networks, hospitals, and healthcare providers, we strive to create solutions that enhance decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and advance the understanding of complex medical conditions.

        I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, working at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. My research focuses on predictive modeling with missing values, time series forecasting, and developing interpretable and reliable models to support clinical decision-making.
                
        Please reach out to collaborate! ðŸš€
