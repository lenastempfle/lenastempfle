      title: ðŸ“š My Research
      text: |
        At the Healthy AI Lab, we take inspiration from real-world healthcare challenges to develop machine learning models and theory that improve clinical decision-making. Collaborating closely with clinician networks, hospitals, and healthcare providers, we aim to enhance decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and deepen our understanding of complex medical conditions.

        I am a Ph.D. student in the Data Science and AI division at Chalmers University of Technology, working at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. My research focuses on predictive modeling with missing values, time series forecasting, and building interpretable, reliable models to support clinical decision-making.
                
        Letâ€™s collaborate! ðŸš€
