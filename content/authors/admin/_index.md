## About Me
I am a final-year PhD candidate in machine learning at Chalmers University of Technology, specializing in interpretable models for clinical decision-making. My researach interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, such as predictions with missing values, and time series predictions, with the goal of developing interpretable and accurate models to assist with clinical decision-making. As I approach graduation in summer 2025, I am eager to apply my expertise in machine learning and data analysis to industry, contributing to the design of human-centered AI systems that create meaningful real-world impact.
