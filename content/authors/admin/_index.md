## About Me
I am a final-year PhD candidate in machine learning at Chalmers University of Technology, specializing in interpretable models for clinical decision-making. My researach interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, such as predictions with missing values, time series predictions and causality/causal inference, with the goal of developing interpretable and accurate models to assist with clinical decision-making. As I approach graduation in summer 2025, I am eager to apply my expertise in machine learning and data analysis to industry, contributing to the design of human-centered AI systems that create meaningful real-world impact.
